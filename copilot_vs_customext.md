## üß† Using Multi-Model Support in GitHub Copilot Chat

### üìå Purpose
With the recent update, GitHub Copilot users in our organization now have access to **multi-model support** within the **Copilot Chat window** in Visual Studio Code. This enhancement allows users to choose the most suitable AI model for their use case directly from the model drop-down.

This documentation provides:
- Steps to use the multi-model selector in GitHub Copilot Chat
- A comparison of available models and when to use each
- Short descriptions with reference links
- Practical use case-to-model mapping
- Tips and disclaimers to help users get the best out of this feature

---

### üë• Audience
All GitHub Copilot users across the organization using the **Visual Studio Code** extension.

## üöÄ How to Use Multi-Model in GitHub Copilot

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Launch the **Copilot Chat** panel from the sidebar or using the shortcut:  
   **`Cmd+I` (Mac)** or **`Ctrl+I` (Windows/Linux)**.
3. Click on the **Model Selector** drop-down at the top of the chat window.
4. Select the model that best suits your use case.

## üôã FAQ (Optional Section)

**Q: Can I change models mid-conversation?**  
A: No, you‚Äôll need to start a new chat to select a different model.

**Q: Is there a performance cost in using GPT-4o vs O3-mini?**  
A: GPT-4o may be heavier on resources but provides deeper reasoning. O3-mini is lightweight and faster.

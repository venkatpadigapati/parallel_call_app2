h1. üöÄ GitHub Copilot Multimodel Support (April 2025)

As of April 2025, our organization has enabled *multimodel support* in the *GitHub Copilot Chat* extension for Visual Studio Code. This allows users to select from multiple AI models directly within the Copilot Chat interface, based on the nature of their task or coding workflow.

This document provides:
* How to use the multimodel feature in Copilot Chat
* Quick overview of available models
* Model selection guidance for various use cases
* Reference links and examples for clarity
* Screenshots for easier understanding

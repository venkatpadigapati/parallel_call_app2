Using Multimodel Option in GitHub Copilot Chat
üìå Purpose
As of April 2025, our organization is enabling the Multimodel support in GitHub Copilot Chat for VS Code. This allows Copilot users to select from multiple AI models depending on the use case or user preference, directly from the Copilot Chat window.

This document explains:

üë• Audience
All GitHub Copilot users in our organization who use Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code.

üß† Model Overview (As of April 2025)
Model	Description	Best For	Link
GPT-4o	OpenAI‚Äôs flagship model with strong reasoning, code generation, multilingual support, and faster speed.	General-purpose coding, debugging, testing, documentation	GPT-4o
Claude 3.5 Sonnet	Safety- and compliance-focused model from Anthropic with strong natural language understanding.	Secure coding, test gen, user documentation	Claude
Claude 3.7 Sonnet	Advanced contextual understanding, longer context handling, better reasoning than 3.5.	Policy enforcement, legacy code migration, IaC	Claude
Gemini 2.0 Flash	Lightweight, fast-response model by Google DeepMind. Works well with cross-domain logic and automation.	CI/CD workflows, API integration, DevOps documentation	Gemini Flash
o1 (Preview)	Experimental performance-optimized model from OpenAI. Good for refactoring and debugging.	Code performance tuning, DevOps scripts, procedural improvements	o1
03-mini	Minimalist OpenAI model ideal for fast syntax and structural improvements.	Code cleanup, formatting, small fix suggestions	03-mini
‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: Model performance may evolve over time. Vendors may update models or capabilities without notice. Refer to their official documentation for the latest updates.

# Using Multimodel Option in GitHub Copilot Chat

## üìå Purpose

As of **April 2025**, our organization is enabling **Multimodel support** in GitHub Copilot Chat for **Visual Studio Code**.  
This allows users to select from multiple AI models based on the use case or user preference, directly from the Copilot Chat window.

This documentation explains:

- How to use the multimodel option  
- Overview of available models  
- Best model recommendations for different coding scenarios  
- Helpful links and disclaimers  
- Screenshots to assist in understanding
